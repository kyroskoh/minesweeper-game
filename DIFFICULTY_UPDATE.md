### Changes from Previous Configuration

#### Size Increases:
- **Easy**: 8x8 → 10x10 (+56 cells)
- **Medium**: 10x10 → 15x15 (+125 cells)
- **Hard**: 15x15 → 20x20 (+175 cells)
- **Expert**: 18x18 → 40x40 (+1,276 cells!)
- **Extreme**: 20x20 → 50x50 (+2,100 cells!)

#### Mine Adjustments:
- **Easy**: 10 mines (unchanged)
- **Medium**: 15 → 25 mines (+67%)
- **Hard**: 35 → 40 mines (+14%)
- **Expert**: 60 → 100 mines (+67%)
- **Extreme**: 80 → 150 mines (+88%)

#### New Addition:
- **Pro**: 30x30 with 50 mines - fills the gap between Hard and Expert

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Dynamic Cell Sizing
Implemented automatic cell resizing based on board dimensions:

```javascript
let cellSize = 30;
if (gameState.rows >= 50 || gameState.cols >= 50) {
  cellSize = 15;
} else if (gameState.rows >= 40 || gameState.cols >= 40) {
  cellSize = 18;
} else if (gameState.rows >= 30 || gameState.cols >= 30) {
  cellSize = 20;
} else if (gameState.rows >= 20 || gameState.cols >= 20) {
  cellSize = 25;
}
```

### 2. Responsive Container
- Container now uses `max-width: 95vw` and `max-height: 95vh`
- Boards scale to fit screen while maintaining playability
- Automatic scrolling for boards that exceed viewport

### 3. CSS Adaptations
- Added data attribute system for cell sizing
- Font sizes scale proportionally with cell size
- Border widths reduced for smaller cells
- Maintained visual consistency across all sizes

### 4. Updated Configurations
All difficulty configurations updated in:
- `app.js` - Client-side difficulty definitions
- `server.js` - Server-side difficulty names and daily puzzle configs
- `index.html` - Button labels and daily puzzle modal

## Gameplay Impact

### Pro Difficulty (NEW)
- **Perfect mid-tier challenge** between Hard and Expert
- 900 cells provide substantial gameplay time
- Lower mine density (5.6%) makes it more approachable than Expert
- Great for players who find Hard too easy but Expert overwhelming

### Expert & Extreme Difficulty Enhancements
- **Massive board sizes** (40x40 and 50x50) provide epic gameplay sessions
- **Lower mine density** compared to old configuration makes them more fair
- **Skill-based placement** ensures solvability even at these scales
- **Visual scaling** maintains playability despite board size

### Easy & Medium Improvements
- **Larger boards** provide more engaging gameplay even at beginner levels
- **Same mine density** maintains difficulty curve
- **Better learning progression** for new players

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization for Large Boards
- Cells render efficiently using CSS Grid
- Dynamic sizing reduces DOM element size
- Board rendering remains smooth even at 2,500 cells (Extreme)
- Memory footprint remains reasonable

### User Experience
- All boards fit within viewport without excessive scrolling
- Cell sizes remain clickable even at smallest scale (15px)
- Visual clarity maintained across all difficulty levels
- Touch-friendly even on mobile devices

## Leaderboard Integration

All new difficulty configurations are fully integrated with:
- Regular leaderboard tracking
- Daily Puzzle system
- Offline score syncing
- Separate tabs for each difficulty including Pro

## Balance Analysis

### Mine Density Comparison
The new configuration provides better balance:

- **Old Expert**: 18.5% mine density (60/324 cells)
- **New Expert**: 6.25% mine density (100/1,600 cells)

This makes Expert more about pattern recognition and less about lucky guesses.

### Progression Curve
1. **Easy** (10x10): Learn basic mechanics
2. **Medium** (15x15): Develop pattern recognition
3. **Hard** (20x20): Master core strategies
4. **Pro** (30x30): Apply advanced techniques
5. **Expert** (40x40): Endurance and consistency
6. **Extreme** (50x50): Ultimate challenge

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all difficulty levels on various screen sizes
2. Verify cell sizing on mobile devices
3. Check leaderboard displays correctly for all difficulties
4. Confirm Daily Puzzle works with all 6 difficulties
5. Validate performance on Extreme difficulty (2,500 cells)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for large boards:
- Zoom controls for Extreme difficulty
- Minimap for Expert/Extreme
- Keyboard navigation for large boards
- Click-and-drag selection for multiple cells
- Undo feature for misclicks on large boards
