# Minesweeper Game

A classic Minesweeper game built with a Node.js/Express backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## Features

- **Five difficulty levels**: Easy (8x8, 10 mines), Medium (10x10, 15 mines), Hard (15x15, 35 mines), Expert (18x18, 60 mines), Extreme (20x20, 80 mines)
- **Classic gameplay**: Left-click to reveal cells, right-click to place flags
- **Auto-reveal**: Empty cells automatically reveal adjacent cells
- **Win detection**: Complete the game by revealing all non-mine cells
- **Timer**: Track your completion time (starts on first move)
- **Leaderboard**: Compare your best times with others for each difficulty level
- **Offline Support**: Scores are saved locally if offline and automatically synced when connection is restored
- **Responsive design**: Clean, modern UI with gradient background

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Game

### SQLite Mode (Default - Single Server)

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3030
   ```

3. Start playing!

### PostgreSQL Mode (High Availability - Multi-Server)

For production deployments across multiple servers:

1. Set up PostgreSQL (see [PostgreSQL HA Setup Guide](POSTGRESQL_HA_SETUP.md))
2. Configure `.env` with your PostgreSQL credentials
3. Migrate existing data: `npm run migrate-to-postgres`
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:postgres
   ```

**üìñ Full setup guide:** [POSTGRESQL_HA_SETUP.md](POSTGRESQL_HA_SETUP.md)

### Docker Mode (Easiest for Production)

Deploy with Docker for simplified setup:

```bash
# Local development (full stack)
docker-compose up -d

# Production (3-server HA setup)
./deploy/deploy-db.sh      # Database server
./deploy/deploy-server1.sh  # App server 1
./deploy/deploy-server2.sh  # App server 2
```

**üìñ Docker guide:** [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### PostgreSQL High Availability with Replication

**Option A: 2-Host Setup (Recommended - Simpler)**

Each host runs both app AND database with auto-sync:
```bash
# Host 1
./deploy/deploy-host1.sh

# Host 2
./deploy/deploy-host2.sh
```

**üìñ 2-host guide:** [TWO_HOST_DEPLOYMENT.md](TWO_HOST_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Option B: 5-Server Setup (Advanced - Dedicated DBs)**

Separate database servers with dedicated coordinator:
```bash
# Local testing (all-in-one)
npm run docker:ha

# Production deployment
# See detailed guide
```

**üìñ 5-server guide:** [POSTGRES_HA_REPLICATION.md](POSTGRES_HA_REPLICATION.md)

## How to Play

**Desktop:**
- **Left Click**: Reveal a cell
- **Right Click**: Place or remove a flag

**Mobile/Touch:**
- **Tap**: Reveal a cell
- **Long Press (500ms)**: Place or remove a flag (vibrates on supported devices)

**Goal:** Reveal all cells that don't contain mines as fast as possible

**Timer:** Starts when you reveal your first cell

**Leaderboard:** Win the game to save your time and compete with others

**Developer Mode:** Type `SHOWMINES` or enter Konami Code to reveal mine positions

## API Endpoints

### Game Endpoints
- `POST /api/game/new` - Create a new game
  - Body: `{ rows, cols, mines }`
  - Returns: Game ID and initial state

- `POST /api/game/:gameId/reveal` - Reveal a cell
  - Body: `{ row, col }`
  - Returns: Updated game state

- `POST /api/game/:gameId/flag` - Toggle flag on a cell
  - Body: `{ row, col }`
  - Returns: Updated game state

- `GET /api/game/:gameId` - Get current game state

### Leaderboard Endpoints
- `POST /api/leaderboard` - Submit a score
  - Body: `{ name, time, difficulty }`
  - Returns: Confirmation and entry

- `GET /api/leaderboard/:difficulty` - Get top 10 scores for a difficulty
  - Returns: Array of leaderboard entries

- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get all leaderboards grouped by difficulty
  - Returns: Object with leaderboards for each difficulty

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, CORS
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (sql.js) for persistent leaderboard storage
- **Game Logic**: Object-oriented JavaScript class

## Database

### SQLite (Default)
The leaderboard scores are stored in `leaderboard.db` (SQLite database). The database is automatically created on first run and includes:
- Player names
- Completion times
- Difficulty levels
- Timestamps

Top 10 scores for each difficulty level are displayed in the leaderboard.

### PostgreSQL (High Availability)
For multi-server deployments, use PostgreSQL mode:
- **Centralized database** - all servers share the same data
- **Real-time synchronization** - scores are instantly visible across servers
- **Scalable** - handles multiple concurrent connections
- **Production-ready** - built-in replication and backup features

See [POSTGRESQL_HA_SETUP.md](POSTGRESQL_HA_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

### Offline Support

The game includes offline functionality for submitting scores:
- If you win while offline or the server is unavailable, your score is saved to **localStorage**
- A yellow banner shows how many scores are pending sync
- When connection is restored, scores are automatically synced to the server
- Original submission timestamps are preserved during sync
- Scores are queued and synced in order

**Testing Offline Mode:**
1. Win a game and submit your score (works normally)
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Select "Offline"
3. Win another game and submit - you'll see "Score saved offline" message
4. A yellow banner appears showing pending scores
5. Disable offline mode in DevTools
6. Refresh the page - scores sync automatically and banner disappears

### Adding Scores Manually

You can add scores manually using the helper script:

```bash
# Using npm script
npm run add-score "Player Name" <time> <difficulty> [date]

# Or directly
node scripts/add-score.js "Player Name" <time> <difficulty> [date]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Time in seconds (uses today's date)
npm run add-score "John Doe" 45 Easy

# Time in mm:ss format (uses today's date)
npm run add-score "Jane Smith" 3:45 Medium

# Time in h:mm:ss format with custom date
npm run add-score "Pro Gamer" 1:23:45 Expert "2025-10-15"

# With different date format
npm run add-score "Speed Runner" 2:30 Hard "10/15/2025"
```

**Valid difficulties:** Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, Extreme

**Time formats:**
- Seconds: `45` (stored as 45 seconds)
- mm:ss: `3:45` (stored as 225 seconds)
- h:mm:ss: `1:23:45` (stored as 5025 seconds)

**Date formats (optional):**
- ISO: `2025-10-20`
- US: `10/20/2025`
- Any valid date string recognized by JavaScript
- If omitted, uses today's date

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Validate the time format
- ‚úÖ Convert time to seconds for storage
- ‚úÖ Validate the date if provided
- ‚úÖ Show the top 5 scores after adding

## Developer Mode

A secret developer mode allows you to see mine positions for testing and debugging.

**Activation (choose one):**
1. Type `SHOWMINES` anywhere on the game page
2. Enter the Konami Code: `‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A`

**What it does:**
- Shows a ‚ö†Ô∏è indicator on unrevealed cells containing mines
- Mines have a yellow tinted background
- Toggle on/off by typing the code again
- Notification appears at top of screen
- Console logs show mode status

**Note:** This is a client-side visual aid only - it doesn't prevent you from hitting mines or affect gameplay.

Enjoy playing Minesweeper! üí£
