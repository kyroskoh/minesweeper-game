## Database

The leaderboard scores are stored in `leaderboard.db` (SQLite database). The database is automatically created on first run and includes:
- Player names
- Completion times
- Difficulty levels
- Timestamps

Top 10 scores for each difficulty level are displayed in the leaderboard.

### Offline Support

The game includes offline functionality for submitting scores:
- If you win while offline or the server is unavailable, your score is saved to **localStorage**
- A yellow banner shows how many scores are pending sync
- When connection is restored, scores are automatically synced to the server
- Original submission timestamps are preserved during sync
- Scores are queued and synced in order

**Testing Offline Mode:**
1. Win a game and submit your score (works normally)
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Select "Offline"
3. Win another game and submit - you'll see "Score saved offline" message
4. A yellow banner appears showing pending scores
5. Disable offline mode in DevTools
6. Refresh the page - scores sync automatically and banner disappears

### Adding Scores Manually

You can add scores manually using the helper script:

```bash
# Using npm script
npm run add-score "Player Name" <time> <difficulty> [date]

# Or directly
node scripts/add-score.js "Player Name" <time> <difficulty> [date]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Time in seconds (uses today's date)
npm run add-score "John Doe" 45 Easy

# Time in mm:ss format (uses today's date)
npm run add-score "Jane Smith" 3:45 Medium

# Time in h:mm:ss format with custom date
npm run add-score "Pro Gamer" 1:23:45 Expert "2025-10-15"

# With different date format
npm run add-score "Speed Runner" 2:30 Hard "10/15/2025"
```

**Valid difficulties:** Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, Extreme

**Time formats:**
- Seconds: `45` (stored as 45 seconds)
- mm:ss: `3:45` (stored as 225 seconds)
- h:mm:ss: `1:23:45` (stored as 5025 seconds)

**Date formats (optional):**
- ISO: `2025-10-20`
- US: `10/20/2025`
- Any valid date string recognized by JavaScript
- If omitted, uses today's date

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Validate the time format
- ‚úÖ Convert time to seconds for storage
- ‚úÖ Validate the date if provided
- ‚úÖ Show the top 5 scores after adding

## Developer Mode

A secret developer mode allows you to see mine positions for testing and debugging.

**Activation (choose one):**
1. Type `SHOWMINES` anywhere on the game page
2. Enter the Konami Code: `‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A`

**What it does:**
- Shows a ‚ö†Ô∏è indicator on unrevealed cells containing mines
- Mines have a yellow tinted background
- Toggle on/off by typing the code again
- Notification appears at top of screen
- Console logs show mode status

**Note:** This is a client-side visual aid only - it doesn't prevent you from hitting mines or affect gameplay.
