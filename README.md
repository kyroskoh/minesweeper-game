The leaderboard scores are stored in `leaderboard.db` (SQLite database). The database is automatically created on first run and includes:

Top 10 scores for each difficulty level are displayed in the leaderboard.

### Adding Scores Manually

You can add scores manually using the helper script:

```bash
# Using npm script
npm run add-score "Player Name" <time> <difficulty> [date]

# Or directly
node scripts/add-score.js "Player Name" <time> <difficulty> [date]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Time in seconds (uses today's date)
npm run add-score "John Doe" 45 Easy

# Time in mm:ss format (uses today's date)
npm run add-score "Jane Smith" 3:45 Medium

# Time in h:mm:ss format with custom date
npm run add-score "Pro Gamer" 1:23:45 Expert "2025-10-15"

# With different date format
npm run add-score "Speed Runner" 2:30 Hard "10/15/2025"
```

**Valid difficulties:** Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, Extreme

**Time formats:**
- Seconds: `45` (stored as 45 seconds)
- mm:ss: `3:45` (stored as 225 seconds)
- h:mm:ss: `1:23:45` (stored as 5025 seconds)

**Date formats (optional):**
- ISO: `2025-10-20`
- US: `10/20/2025`
- Any valid date string recognized by JavaScript
- If omitted, uses today's date

The script will:
- âœ… Validate the time format
- âœ… Convert time to seconds for storage
- âœ… Validate the date if provided
- âœ… Show the top 5 scores after adding
