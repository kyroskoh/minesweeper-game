# Puzzle of the Day - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a "Puzzle of the Day" feature for the Minesweeper game with the following capabilities:

## Key Features

### 1. **All Difficulties Use Skill-Based Placement**
- Easy and Medium now use the same solvable mine placement algorithm as Hard/Expert/Extreme
- Mine placement creates logical patterns with clusters to produce higher numbers (4, 5, 6)
- This reduces random guessing and makes games more skill-based

### 2. **Daily Puzzle System**
- Each day generates a unique, deterministic puzzle based on date seed
- Everyone gets the same puzzle for the same day
- Available in all 6 difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Pro, Expert, Extreme)
- Seed calculation: `year * 10000 + month * 100 + day`

### 3. **Seeded Random Generation**
- Implemented Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for reproducible randomness
- Same seed always produces same mine layout
- Uses formula: `state = (state * 1664525 + 1013904223) % 4294967296`

### 4. **Daily Puzzle Leaderboard**
- Separate leaderboard tab for Daily Puzzle scores
- Shows scores across all difficulties
- Database tracks if score is from daily puzzle (`is_daily` column)
- Players can compete globally on the same puzzle

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**
- ðŸ“… Daily Puzzle button in main interface
- Modal to select difficulty for daily puzzle
- Different win/retry messages for daily puzzles
- Option to try different difficulties after completing one

## Technical Changes

### Backend (server.js)
- Added `seed` parameter to `MinesweeperGame` constructor
- Implemented `seededRandom()` method for deterministic RNG
- Added `random()` method that uses seeded or regular Math.random()
- Updated all random calls in mine placement to use `this.random()`
- New API endpoint: `POST /api/game/daily` 
- Added `is_daily` column to database schema
- Modified leaderboard endpoint to track daily puzzle scores

### Frontend (app.js & index.html)
- Added Daily Puzzle modal with difficulty selection
- New `isDailyPuzzle` flag to track game mode
- Updated `handleGameOver()` to handle daily puzzle flow
- Modified score submission to include `isDailyPuzzle` parameter
- Added Daily tab to leaderboard modal
- Updated UI with new buttons and styling

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE leaderboard ADD COLUMN is_daily INTEGER DEFAULT 0
```

## Usage

### Playing Daily Puzzle
1. Click "ðŸ“… Daily Puzzle" button
2. Select difficulty level
3. Play the puzzle - same layout as everyone else for that day
4. Submit score to Daily Puzzle leaderboard

### Viewing Leaderboard
- Regular difficulty tabs show all scores for that difficulty
- Daily tab shows all daily puzzle scores across difficulties
- Displays difficulty column in Daily leaderboard

## Benefits
- **Fair Competition**: Everyone plays same puzzle
- **Skill-Based**: Logical mine patterns reduce luck factor
- **Replayability**: Can try different difficulties each day
- **Community**: Global leaderboard creates engagement
- **Consistency**: Deterministic generation ensures reliability
